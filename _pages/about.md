About Me
======
I am a MS student in the [Cantley Lab of Plant Evolution](https://cantleylab.wixsite.com/jasoncantley) at San Francisco State University. My current research focuses on _Chenopodium oahuense_, an amaranth subspecies complex endemic to the Hawaiian archipelago.

My undergraduate research took place under the supervision of [Maddelyn Harden](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maddelyn-Harden) and [Sergey Nuzhdin](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nlab/people/) at the University of Southern California's [Sergey Nuzhdin Lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/nlab/). My bachelor's degree in Environmental Science & Health was awarded by the USC Wrigley Institute for Environment & Sustainability, then the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies.
